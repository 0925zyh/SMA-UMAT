# SMA-UMAT
In this folder, there are two UMAT for the constituive law of SMAs

1.Finite_Strain_SMA_UMAT.for, this file is the UMAT when SMAs undergo large deformations. See reference paper for the detail, 
Xu, Lei, Theocharis Baxevanis, and D. C. Lagoudas. "A three-dimensional constitutive model for the martensitic transformation in polycrystalline shape memory alloys under large deformation." Smart Materials and Structures 28.7 (2019): 074004. https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1361-665x%2Fab1acb

2.SMA-TRIP.for, this file is the UMAT simulates the constitutive behaviour of SMAs considering the transformation-induced plasticity(TRIP) and the two-way shape memory effect(TWSME), see the following paper as reference.
Lei Xu, Alexandros Solomou, Theocharis Baxevanis, Dimitris Lagoudas, Finite strain constitutive modeling for shape memory alloys considering transformation-induced plasticity and two-way shape memory effect, International Journal of Solids and Structures,2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2020.03.009.

A detailed tutorial will be provided soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to send emails to sdf007xulei@gmail.com. At the same time, please cite the paper accordingly if you plan to use this open resources for you research.
